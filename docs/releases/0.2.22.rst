0.2.22 (2023-09-11)
-------------------

Fixed a bad bug in theme selection: If you selected a theme which was
stored in the session, for html fragments rendered via the json api the
pre selected theme was used instead, because the real request was not
past from the json api to the wagtail page. This caused the vue theme
to be completely broken. This is fixed now.

- Fixed mypy issues by django-stubs update + one small fix #101
