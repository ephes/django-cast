-------------------

It would be nice if the feed repository could use the same statements that are used
to fetch the data for the blog index. Further optimizations of the statements would
be beneficial for both use cases.

Now podlove web player 5 is used by default. This is important because adding a
transcript feature depends on this player version. It is now also possible to
overwrite the template that is used for an audio block in a theme. This is useful
if you want to heavily customize the appearance of the player.

- #65 Use podlove web player 5
- #132 Create the feed repository from cachable data, too
- #137 Make `audio.html` template themeable via `template_base_dir`
