0.2.50 (unreleased)
-------------------

New Features:

- Django 6.0 compatibility
- Added ``justfile`` for streamlined development commands (``just test``, ``just lint``, ``just typecheck``, ``just docs``, etc.)
- Replaced ``django-fluent-comments`` with a built-in comments app (``cast.comments``) based on ``django-contrib-comments``.
  The new implementation keeps the existing spam moderation via ``cast.moderation.Moderator`` and maintains template/static/tag
  compatibility for existing deployments.

Other Changes:

- Updated developer documentation (``docs/development.rst`` and ``docs/architecture.rst``)
- Comment UX parity improvements (inline preview, AJAX posting, HTMX-safe event handling) and styled fallback pages for non-JS clients.
- Reduced dependencies by removing ``django-fluent-comments`` and ``python-akismet``.
