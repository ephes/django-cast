0.2.19 (2023-08-21)
-------------------

Added tags and categories for posts. I planned for long adding a feature
like this, but avoided implementing it because I didn't understand what I
did in `filters.py`. It's a beta feature and I probably will keep only
categories or tags, but not both.

- Updated some documentation in top level README.md
- Added tags / categories to posts #100 ðŸ˜…
- Temporarily deactivated the mypy pre-commit hook because mypy 1.5.0 is not compatible with django-stubs
- Had to drop support for Wagtail 3 because of conflicting migrations (taggit)
