0.2.51 (2025-12-21)
-------------------

Fixes:

- Render cover images on post detail and blog index pages, including alt text and blog-level fallback.
- Add social meta tags to the plain theme and include ``twitter:title`` for summary cards.
- Generate social preview renditions (1200x630) with focal-point cropping and absolute image URLs,
  and switch post cards to ``summary_large_image`` with ``og:image`` dimensions.

Other Changes:

- Blog index queries select related cover images to avoid N+1 lookups.
- Developer docs now emphasize running ``just lint`` and ``just typecheck`` after code changes.
