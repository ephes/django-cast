-------------------

Fixes:

- Render cover images on post detail and blog index pages, including alt text and blog-level fallback.
- Add social meta tags to the plain theme and include ``twitter:title`` for summary cards.

Other Changes:

- Blog index queries select related cover images to avoid N+1 lookups.
- Developer docs now emphasize running ``just typecheck`` after code changes.
