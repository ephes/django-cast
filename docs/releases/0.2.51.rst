0.2.51 (2025-12-21)
-------------------

Fixes:

- Keep cover images for social meta tags only, with alt text emitted in ``twitter:image:alt`` and ``og:image:alt``.
- Use cached ``page_url`` in plain theme post lists to avoid ``/None/`` links when rendering repository posts.
- Use ``jpegquality-75`` in social cover renditions to avoid invalid filter spec errors.
- Add social meta tags to the plain theme and include ``twitter:title`` for summary cards.
- Generate social preview renditions (1200x630) with focal-point cropping and absolute image URLs,
  and switch post cards to ``summary_large_image`` with ``og:image`` dimensions.

Other Changes:

- Blog index queries select related cover images to avoid N+1 lookups.
- Developer docs now emphasize running ``just lint`` and ``just typecheck`` after code changes.
