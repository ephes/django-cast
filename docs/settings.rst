Custom Theme Configuration
==========================

To configure custom themes for the site, use the ``CAST_CUSTOM_THEMES`` setting.
By default, it is set to an empty list ``[]``. Each theme requires two elements:
a name and a display. For instance:

.. code-block:: python

    CAST_CUSTOM_THEMES = [
        # (name, display)
        ("my_theme", "My Theme"),
        ("my_other_theme", "My Other Theme"),
    ]

The display value is the title displayed in the theme selector within the Wagtail
admin panel. The name corresponds to the theme's base directory inside your templates
folder. To create a theme named my_theme, make a directory called ``cast/my_theme``
within your templates folder and place your templates inside.
